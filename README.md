# Delete SoftwareDistribution

Very new to this, so please, don't think I have any clue what they heck is going on. This just worked for me. 
Please for all that is good and holy, test before using in your given enviorment. 

# Ideas:
    x Add validation checks while maintaining automation/zero user interaction.
    x Return ownership to proper account.
    - Post policy/config eval actions -- SCCM evals
